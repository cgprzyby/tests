This repository uses the Web3 API in Javascript to:
- Connect to a Parity node
- Connect to a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain
- Call functions within a Solidity smart contract

Using Mozilla performance.now(), speed tests are performed to
calculate the response time for making a request to get data
off of the Ethereum blockchain. For my testing purposes, I connected
to a MetaMask wallet and connected to a smart contract on the Ropsten TestNet.
